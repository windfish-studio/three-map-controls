# three-map-controls
Map Controls class for ThreeJS; pan and zoom with respect to a ThreeJS [_Plane_](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane) or [_Sphere_](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Sphere).

The aim of this library is to provide a ThreeJS-compatible interface by which a user can interact with a map, either two-dimensonal (a plane) or three-dimensonal (a sphere). The controls provided are meant to behave in the most _natural_ way possible for cartographic navigation; e.g. panning the map by dragging the mouse should keep the same point under the cursor as the map moves. 
## Usage

```javascript
import MapControls from 'three-map-controls'

const radius = 6.0;
new MapControls( camera, renderer.domElement, {
    mode: 'sphere',
    target: new Sphere(new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0), radius),
    minDistance: 2.0,
    maxDistance: 20
});
```

##### Change Log

###### v1.1.3 - Jun 07 2019

Lots of big changes in the latest version, namely supporting a spherical target mode (e.g. a globe instead of a 2D map). 

As well, v1.1.3 introduces a _targetAreaVisible()_ function which returns the currently-visible portion of the map, in world coordinates. 

In spherical mode, _targetAreaVisible()_ returns a bounding box in spherical coordinates (theta and phi, in radians). Translating these coordinates to degrees will yield a latitude-longitude bounding box. 

These changes are reflected in the tests, which now use the Ava testing framework. As well, the [jsfiddle demo](https://jsfiddle.net/sikanrong/m8c250o2/) has been updated to show off the new functionality.

###### v1.0.1 - May 19 2018

Update the project to use ES6-style classes and function scoping features. Removes previous ES6 compatability hacks. Switches out browserify for webpack. Packages demo and test bundles with webpack, moving test
suite to the client. 

Finally adding a universal zoomToFit(mesh) function which optimally fills the screen with a given geometry by dollying the camera towards or away from it. 

Adjust the relationship of pan/dolly Vector math within update(). 

## API

#### Member Variables


###### target: Plane|Sphere
Must be set to instance of threejs Plane or Sphere. *required*
```javascript
mapControls.target = new Sphere(new Vector3(0,0,0), 5);
```

###### mode: string
Must either be set to 'sphere' or 'plane'. *required*
```javascript
mapControls.mode = 'sphere';
```

###### enabled: boolean
Set to false to disable all input events.
```javascript
mapControls.enabled = true;
```

###### min/maxDistance: number
How far you can dolly the camera in and out from the target geometry. 
```javascript
mapControls.minDistance = 1; //probably should never be 0
mapControls.maxDistance = 100;
```

###### enableZoom: boolean
Set to false to disable all camera-dolly events.
```javascript
mapControls.enableZoom = true; 
```

###### zoomSpeed: number
Set speed of camera dolly; how fast the camera will move towards the target geometry on mousewheel events
```javascript
mapControls.zoomSpeed = 3.0; 
```

###### zoomDampingAlpha: number
Set the damping of the dolly movement; makes the camera dolly movement feel smoother.
```javascript
mapControls.zoomDampingAlpha = 0.1; 
```

###### enablePan: boolean
Set to false to disable camera pan inputs. In 'sphere' mode, this disables rotation of the camera about the sphere.
```javascript
mapControls.enablePan = true;
```

###### panDampingAlpha: number
Sets the damping of the pan movement; makes camera pan movement feel smoother.
```javascript
mapControls.panDampingAlpha = 0.2;
```

###### enableKeys: boolean
Enable/disable keyboard input
```javascript
mapControls.enableKeys = true;
```

###### keyPanSpeed: number
Define how fast the camera should pan for each keypress. Everything on the screen should move this many pixels per kepress.
```javascript
mapControls.keyPanSpeed = 12.0; 
```

###### keys: object
Define the keyboard char-codes which map to each pan movement.
```javascript
mapControls.keys = { LEFT: 37, UP: 38, RIGHT: 39, BOTTOM: 40 };
```
###### mouseButtons: object
Define the mouse buttons and what action each one is mapped to. (Note: all values are from the threejs MOUSE enumeration)
```javascript
mapControls.mouseButtons = { ZOOM: THREE.MOUSE.MIDDLE, PAN: THREE.MOUSE.LEFT };
```

#### Member Functions

###### getZoomAlpha(void): number
returns current zoom value as a range between 0 and 1; zero represents the camera at mapControls.maxDistance from the target geometry (plane or sphere), and 1 is the camera at mapControls.maxDistance.
```javascript
mapControls.getZoomAlpha();
```

###### update(void): void
Called on each animation frame, updates all of the internal calculations and the camera position/lookAt vectors. 
```javascript
mapControls.update();
```

###### targetAreaVisible(void): [Box3](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Box3)
Returns the bounding box which defines the currently-visible area of the map, in world coordinates. 

In spherical mode, returns a bounding box in spherical coordinates (Θ and φ; in radians). Translating these coordinates to degrees will yield a latitude-longitude bounding box. 
```javascript
mapControls.update();
```

## TODO

- Add typescript type definitions. 
- Add JSDoc documentation

## Testing
```bash
npm run test
